# CMS Makers
The CMS Makers Working Group is a collaborative initiative involving contributors from [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Drupal](https://drupal.org/), and other members of the [Open Website Alliance](https://openwebsitealliance.org/).

## Purpose
The initial purpose of the working group is to address the Maker-Taker imbalance in open-source communities by enhancing contribution recognition, incentivization, resource sharing, and promoting sustainability, resilience, and interoperability across platforms.

Bringing together contributors from the [WordPress Sustainability](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/) and [Drupal Innovation](https://www.drupal.org/innovation/) teams, this partnership will draw on the unique strengths of each community focusing on projects like Five for the Future and the Drupal Innovation Hub. Together, they will share knowledge, pool resources, and work towards shared goals that support a balanced contribution ecosystem.

## Projects
* [Five for the Future](https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/) is a WordPress initiative designed to ensure the platform's sustainability by encouraging contributions from individuals and organizations. The program focuses on improving contributor recognition, transparency, and participation, with the ultimate goal of fostering a balanced ecosystem that strengthens community engagement and supports WordPress's long-term success.
* [Drupal Innovation Hub](https://www.drupal.org/project/innovation_hub) aims to nurture the next generation of innovation within the Drupal ecosystem by addressing challenges such as perception of stagnation, fragmented community efforts, and low visibility for innovative projects. The goal is to showcase Drupalâ€™s adaptability and ensure its continued relevance in a competitive landscape.
